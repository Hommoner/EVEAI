# EVEAI
EVEAI is a Deep Learning Library based on python Keras and Tensorflow.
EVEAI dll allows embedding inference images from keras models into user-written applications. Under Windows, the EVEAI training Tool provides services to train user specific image datasets and EVEAI dll provides services to existing Windows applications which support inference images.
